# WebForms Classes

WebForms Core technology was created by [Elanat](https://elanat.net). It is a two-way protocol between the WebForms class on the server side and the [web-forms.js](https://github.com/elanatframework/Web_forms/blob/elanat_framework/web-forms.js) library on the client side, where processing is done on the client side and the server sends Action Control commands to [WebFormsJS](https://github.com/elanatframework/Web_forms).

WebForms Core technology is fully supported on the core of the [CodeBehind Framework](https://github.com/elanatframework/Code_behind).

## Feel free to create pull requests
In this repository, you convert the WebForms class in the CodeBehind framework (written in C# programming language) into a WebForms class in your desired programming language.

The WebForms class is available in the CodeBehind framework at the following link:

https://github.com/elanatframework/Code_behind/blob/elanat_framework/class/WebForms.cs

The pull request should include a directory with the same name as the programming language, and in this directory a class called WebForms with the corresponding postcode should be created. The WebForms class must be based on the WebForms class in the CodeBehind framework.

We encourage web professionals to module the WebForms Core technology so that it is easily available in web frameworks. The contents of the module must be added in a directory with the same name as the corresponding framework in the framework's programming language.

Note: You do not need to use the CodeBehind namespace to create a WebForms class for programming languages. If you are creating a new module to be used in web frameworks, you must add the namespace for the relevant web framework.
